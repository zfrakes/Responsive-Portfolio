# Responsive-Portfolio
This Responive-Portfolio was created by Zoey Frakes.My Responsive- Portfolio is design to ensure that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. This task is useful, because as a developer I likely will be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.
